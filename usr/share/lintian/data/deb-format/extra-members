# List of extra members permitted in the .deb files
#
# Format is:
#   <name> => <position>
#
#
# <position> is a 0-indexed position of where the extra member is
# expected.  It can be "ANYWHERE" if the order is not relevant.  Note
# despite of the value of <position>, any member appearing before the
# data.tar member MUST have a name starting with "_".  If not Lintian
# will presume it is the control.tar or the data.tar member (depending
# on how early it occurs).  It is impossible for any valid "2.0" deb
# file to have an extra member at position 0 (which is exclusively
# reserved for the "debian-binary" member)
#
# For Debian, no extra members are defined, so the file is empty atm.
