PeaZip icons for system integration are saved in (peazip)/res/share/icons folder, with (peazip) being the directory containing PeaZip application.

WINDOWS
On Windows systems, replacing the .ico and .icl files in this folder changes PeaZip system icons for context menu and file type associations.
Windows may need to rebuild its icon cache before showing the updated icons, in this case please refer to a guide for your specific system version https://www.google.com/search?q=rebuild+icon+cache+windows

LINUX

Linux .dsktop files for system integration are provided in (peazip)/res/share/batch/freedesktop_integration folder.
