 This code was published by its author(s) as an easily reusable piece of free
 software, for example to demonstrate some particular programming practice. It
 is likely too short or obvious to skilled programmers to fall under, or
 deserve, the protection of copyright legislation. It is also likely to be
 useless on its own, unless verified and integrated into a larger program by an
 experienced software engineer, and therefore no consumer protection, warranty
 or liability rights apply either. Therefore, its author(s) refused to
 disfigure its appearance with a lengthy copyright license text.
 .
 Nevertheless, overly cautious lawyers (possibly as part of a “due diligence
 exercise”) occasionally contact authors of such short code snippets for a
 formal copyright license.
 .
 Therefore, the author(s) agree(s) to clarify that, at the user’s choice, the
 code can be used under any of the following licenses, or any compatible with
 them:
 .
 - Apache License, 2.0
 - BSD license
 - GNU General Public License (GPL)
 - GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)
 - MIT license
 - Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL)
 - Common Development and Distribution License
 - Eclipse Public License
Comment: In a mail to #740281 the author explains his "reluctance to add
 formal copyright licences to work that is probably far too short and trivial
 to fall under copyright legislation", work that is not strictly code and a
 compilation of single sentences from unknown people. mgk-short-license is the
 license he would have put on it if it was a substantial piece of code, so
 since the file appears and is used in the context of code, to capture the
 spirit of how the author intends his work to be used and to argue that this is
 without doubt DFSG-free, the license is reproduced here as illustration and
 guideline.
