Comment: Upstream decided to change the license without getting consent from
 all past contributors. So in practice, code added from 0.417 onward is under
 Apache-2.0 while the previous remain in under the same license as perl itself,
 that is Artistic or GPL-1+.
 .
 New files are using Apache-2.0 only and should be in the relevant paragraph
 below.
 .
 Refer to README.md and https://github.com/perl5-utils/List-MoreUtils/issues/24
